  "how_solve":" Where to start?\n\nStart with the simplest level - the addition of single-digit numbers, and bring it to perfection: 99% correct answers, for each answer 1-2 seconds. To solve the 10-step examples, try using the following technique - “Lean on ten”. \n\nLets say you need to add 8 and 7. \n\n1) Ask yourself how much 8 is not enough to 10 (thats 2). \n\n2) Imagine 7 as the sum of 2 and some other piece (this is 5). \n\n3) Add to 8 first the part of the number 7 that was missing before 10, and then that second piece - you get 10 and 5, and this, of course, is 15. \n\nWhat about subtraction? \n\nAnd here you need to start from the basic level - subtracting a single number from the first and second ten - and bring this skill to perfection. As with addition, problems usually arise with subtraction through 10. And here a similar way of leaning on a dozen will help. \n\nLet say we need to subtract 8. \n\n1) Ask yourself how much you need to subtract from 12 to get 10 (thats 2). \n\n2) We will subtract 8 from 12 in parts - first we subtract this 2, and then everything else. And the rest is how much? (thats 6). \n\n3) After subtracting 2 from 12, we got 10, and we need to subtract 6 more, we get 4. Done! \n\nHow does multiplication work? \n\nLets start by multiplying single-digit numbers. First you need to remember that multiplication is when the same thing is added several times. For example, multiplying 4 by 7 means adding four sevens. Using the technique of addition, we can easily calculate - two sevens, 7 and 7, will be 14, if we add a third 7, we get 21, and adding the last, fourth seven, as a result, we get 28. \n\nGradually, as a result of training, you will remember the reference values ​​of multiplication that are convenient for you and with their help you will be able to quickly calculate the adjacent ones. For example, if you need to multiply 6 by 7 (that is, add six sevens), and you remember that 5 times 7 (that is, add five sevens) will be 35, then to get the final result, you just need to add the sixth seven - it will turn out 42. \n\nThe most difficult example in the multiplication table is 7 ∙ 8. To memorize it, there is a good mnemonic rule five six seven eight, which means 56 = 7 ∙ 8. \n\nThere is only one last action left, division? \n\nYes, we are on the home stretch. And again, lets start from the simplest level: dividing by a single-digit number of those numbers that are familiar to us from multiplying single-digit ones. \n\nSo what is division? In fact, this is the inverse operation to multiplication. \n\nFor example, dividing 56 by 7 means choosing a number such that if you multiply it by 7, you get 56. Since you are already well-versed in the multiplication table by this point, you will probably remember that 8 multiplied by 7 gives 56. Hence, the required number is 8, 56: 7 = 8. \n\nAnd so it is always - remember which number gives the desired result when multiplied - this is the number you need. \n\n ",
